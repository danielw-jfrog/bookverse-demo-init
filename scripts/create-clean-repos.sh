# BookVerse Platform - Repository Forking and Setup Script
# =============================================================================
#
# This comprehensive repository management script automates the forking of
# BookVerse service repositories from an upstream organization to a target
# organization, with optional local cloning and remote configuration for
# enterprise-grade microservices repository management and independent
# CI/CD operations across the complete BookVerse platform ecosystem.
#
# 🏗️ REPOSITORY FORKING STRATEGY:
#     - Upstream Forking: Automated forking from upstream organization repositories
#     - Service Isolation: Complete service code isolation with preserved Git history
#     - GitHub Integration: Automated GitHub repository forking with interactive confirmation
#     - Local Cloning: Optional local repository cloning with proper remote configuration
#     - CI/CD Optimization: Repository structure ready for independent CI/CD operations
#     - Safety Mechanisms: Dry run mode and interactive confirmation for safe operations
#
# 🔧 FORKING PROCEDURES:
#     - Upstream Detection: Automatic detection of upstream repository existence
#     - Fork Creation: GitHub API-based repository forking with proper configuration
#     - Remote Configuration: Upstream and origin remote setup for local clones
#     - Branch Tracking: Main branch tracking and upstream synchronization setup
#     - Interactive Confirmation: User confirmation for repository forking and overwrite
#     - Error Recovery: Comprehensive error handling and recovery procedures
#
# 🛡️ ENTERPRISE SECURITY AND GOVERNANCE:
#     - Safe Repository Operations: Comprehensive safety mechanisms for repository operations
#     - Authentication Management: Secure GitHub authentication and authorization
#     - Repository Access Control: Private repository creation with secure access management
#     - Audit Trail: Complete repository creation and configuration audit logging
#     - Data Protection: Secure handling of sensitive data during repository operations
#     - Rollback Capabilities: Repository operation rollback and disaster recovery
#
# 🔄 REPOSITORY LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT:
#     - Fork Validation: Repository fork existence validation and verification
#     - Local Cloning: Optional local repository cloning with proper remote setup
#     - Remote Management: Upstream and origin remote configuration for sync
#     - Interactive Workflow: User-guided repository forking with confirmation prompts
#     - Batch Processing: Support for multiple service repository forking
#     - Status Reporting: Comprehensive status reporting and operation logging
#
# 📈 SCALABILITY AND AUTOMATION:
#     - Dry Run Mode: Safe testing and validation without actual repository changes
#     - Batch Processing: Efficient processing of multiple service repositories
#     - Template-Based Creation: Consistent repository structure and configuration
#     - Error Recovery: Automated error recovery and repository cleanup procedures
#     - Performance Optimization: Optimized file operations and Git performance
#     - Monitoring Integration: Repository creation monitoring and status reporting
#
# 🔐 ADVANCED SAFETY FEATURES:
#     - Dry Run Validation: Complete operation validation without making changes
#     - Interactive Confirmation: User confirmation for destructive operations
#     - Data Protection: Protection against data loss during repository operations
#     - Rollback Mechanisms: Complete rollback capabilities for failed operations
#     - Validation Framework: Repository integrity validation and verification
#     - Security Scanning: Repository security validation and compliance checking
#
# 🛠️ TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
#     - GitHub CLI Integration: Native GitHub repository management via gh CLI

#
# Authors: BookVerse Platform Team
# Version: 1.0.0
# Last Updated: 2024
#
# Dependencies:
#   - GitHub CLI (gh) with authentication (repository management)
#   - Git with proper configuration (version control operations)
#   - rsync for advanced file copying (file operations)
#   - Bash 4.0+ with array support (script execution environment)
#   - Network connectivity to GitHub (repository creation and push operations)
#
# Usage:
#   ./create-clean-repos.sh [OPTIONS]
#   
#   Options:
#     --target-org ORG      Target GitHub organization for forks
#                           (default: detected from git config or tomjfrog)
#     --upstream-org ORG    Upstream GitHub organization to fork from
#                           (default: yonatanp-jfrog)
#     --dry-run             Enable dry run mode (no actual changes)
#     --clone-local          Clone forked repos locally after forking
#     --help                Show this help message
#   
#   Examples:
#     ./create-clean-repos.sh --target-org tomjfrog --upstream-org yonatanp-jfrog
#     ./create-clean-repos.sh --target-org myorg --dry-run
#     ./create-clean-repos.sh --target-org myorg --clone-local
#
# Safety Notes:
#   - Use dry run mode for testing and validation before actual operations
#   - Interactive confirmation prompts for repository forking
#   - Upstream repositories are not modified
#   - Forked repositories maintain connection to upstream for synchronization
