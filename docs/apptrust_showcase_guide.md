---------------------------

BookVerse QA Gate - Blocking vs Warning Policy Demonstration

Updated Policy Configuration - Now with BLOCKING Enforcement

### Current Policy Matrix:

| Policy Name | Evidence Type | Mode | Expected Result | Impact |
|-------------|---------------|------|----------------|--------|
| **DEV Stage Completion** | DEV.Exit Certification | 🚫 **BLOCK** | FAIL (missing) | **BLOCKS PROMOTION** |
| **SBOM Required** | CycloneDX SBOM | ⚠️ WARNING | FAIL (missing) | Warning only |
| **Integration Tests** | Custom Integration Tests | ⚠️ WARNING | FAIL (missing) | Warning only |
| **STAGING Check** | STAGING.Exit Certification | 🚫 **BLOCK** | FAIL (expected) | **BLOCKS PROMOTION** |
| **Prod Readiness** | Production Readiness | 🚫 **BLOCK** | FAIL (expected) | **BLOCKS PROMOTION** |

### Key Changes Made:

#### Switched to BLOCKING Mode:
1. ✅ **DEV Stage Completion** → **BLOCK** 
   - Critical requirement: No QA entry without DEV completion
   - **Will block promotion** if DEV.Exit evidence missing

2. ✅ **STAGING Check** → **BLOCK**
   - Demo rule showing blocking for inappropriate evidence
   - **Will block promotion** (expected behavior for demo)

3. ✅ **Production Readiness** → **BLOCK**
   - Demo rule for missing future-stage evidence  
   - **Will block promotion** (expected behavior for demo)

#### Remained in WARNING Mode:
- **SBOM Required** → Still warning (could be upgraded to block)
- **Integration Tests** → Still warning (demonstrates flexibility)

### Demonstration Scenarios:

#### 🚫 **BLOCKING Behavior:**
When evaluating for QA entry, the system will now:
- **BLOCK** if DEV stage completion evidence is missing
- **BLOCK** if STAGING evidence inappropriately exists (demo scenario)
- **BLOCK** if production readiness evidence inappropriately exists (demo scenario)
- **Continue with warnings** for SBOM and integration test evidence

#### ⚠️ **WARNING Behavior:**
- SBOM and Integration Test policies will generate warnings but allow promotion
- Provides visibility into compliance without stopping the workflow

### Enforcement Impact:

```
Evaluation Result: FAIL (BLOCKING)
├── DEV Completion: MISSING → 🚫 BLOCKS
├── STAGING Check: MISSING → 🚫 BLOCKS (demo)
├── Prod Readiness: MISSING → 🚫 BLOCKS (demo)
├── SBOM Evidence: MISSING → ⚠️ WARNING
└── Integration Tests: MISSING → ⚠️ WARNING

Final Decision: PROMOTION BLOCKED
Reason: 3 blocking policies failed
```

## 🎯 Perfect Enforcement Demonstration:

This configuration now shows:
- **Real enforcement power** of the Unified Policy Service
- **Flexible policy modes** (block vs warning)
- **Comprehensive quality gates** with actual blocking
- **Demo scenarios** showing different failure types
- **Production-ready** enforcement capabilities

The BookVerse QA entry gate will now **actually prevent promotions** when critical evidence requirements are not met!
