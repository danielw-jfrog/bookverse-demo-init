## 🚀 Initial Setup

The BookVerse platform setup is streamlined using GitHub Actions workflows. Follow these steps to get started:

### Overview

The setup process consists of three main steps:
1. **Fork Service Repositories** - Get your own copies of all service repositories
2. **🔄 Switch Platform Workflow** - Configure all repositories and generate evidence keys (primary method)
3. **🚀 Setup Platform Workflow** - Provision JFrog Platform infrastructure

---

### Step 1: Fork Service Repositories

Before you can deploy the BookVerse platform, you need to fork the service repositories from the upstream organization to your own GitHub organization or user account.

**Why Fork?**
The BookVerse demo consists of multiple service repositories that need to be under your control to:
- Configure repository secrets and variables
- Set up CI/CD workflows with your JFrog Platform
- Customize settings for your environment
- Maintain your own codebase

**Quick Fork Setup:**

Use the automated forking script to fork all service repositories at once:

```bash
# Navigate to the bookverse-demo-init repository
cd bookverse-demo-init

# Authenticate with GitHub CLI (if not already done)
gh auth login

# Fork all repositories to your GitHub account/organization
./scripts/create-clean-repos.sh --target-org YOUR_ORG --upstream-org yonatanp-jfrog --clone-local
```

**Script Options:**
- `--target-org ORG`: Your GitHub organization or username (default: auto-detected from current repo)
- `--upstream-org ORG`: Upstream organization to fork from (default: `yonatanp-jfrog`)
- `--dry-run`: Preview what would be forked without making changes
- `--clone-local`: Automatically clone forked repos locally after forking
- `--help`: Show detailed usage information

**Examples:**
```bash
# Fork to your personal GitHub account
./scripts/create-clean-repos.sh --target-org yourusername --clone-local

# Fork to an organization (dry run first to preview)
./scripts/create-clean-repos.sh --target-org your-org --dry-run

# Fork and clone locally in one step
./scripts/create-clean-repos.sh --target-org your-org --upstream-org yonatanp-jfrog --clone-local
```

**What Gets Forked?**

The script forks these service repositories:
- `bookverse-inventory` - Product catalog and inventory management
- `bookverse-recommendations` - AI-powered recommendation engine
- `bookverse-checkout` - Order processing and payment management
- `bookverse-platform` - Platform coordination and API gateway
- `bookverse-web` - Frontend web application
- `bookverse-helm` - Kubernetes deployment charts

---

### Step 2: Configure with Switch Platform Workflow ⭐

**The 🔄 Switch Platform workflow is the primary method for configuring BookVerse.** It automatically configures all repositories, generates evidence keys, and sets up everything you need.

**2a. Configure GitHub Repository Secrets**

Before running the Switch Platform workflow, set up repository secrets in the `bookverse-demo-init` repository:

1. Navigate to: `https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/bookverse-demo-init/settings/secrets/actions`
2. Add the following secrets:
   - **`JFROG_ADMIN_TOKEN`**: Your JFrog Platform admin token (required)
   - **`GH_TOKEN`**: GitHub Personal Access Token (optional - see note below)

**About GitHub Tokens:**

- **`GITHUB_TOKEN`**: Automatically provided by GitHub Actions for each workflow run. It has permissions to the repository where the workflow runs. The Switch Platform workflow uses this by default if `GH_TOKEN` is not set.
  
- **`GH_TOKEN`**: Used by the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for authentication. If you need broader permissions (e.g., to update variables/secrets across multiple repositories in your organization), you can create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with `repo`, `workflow`, and `admin:repo_hook` scopes and set it as the `GH_TOKEN` secret.

**When to set `GH_TOKEN`:**
- ✅ **Required** if the workflow needs to update repositories outside the current repository
- ✅ **Required** if you need organization-level permissions
- ✅ **Optional** if all operations are within the same repository (uses `GITHUB_TOKEN` by default)

**How to create a GitHub PAT for `GH_TOKEN`:**
1. Go to: `https://github.com/settings/tokens`
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Set expiration and select scopes: `repo`, `workflow`, `admin:repo_hook`
4. Copy the token and add it as the `GH_TOKEN` secret in your repository

**2b. Run Switch Platform Workflow**

The Switch Platform workflow will configure all repositories and generate evidence keys automatically:

1. Navigate to: `https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/bookverse-demo-init/actions`
2. Select **"🔄 Switch Platform"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"**
4. Configure the workflow inputs:
   - **Setup Mode**: `initial_setup` ⭐ (for first-time setup)
   - **JFrog Platform Host**: `https://your-instance.jfrog.io`
   - **Admin Token**: (leave empty - uses `JFROG_ADMIN_TOKEN` secret)
   - **Generate Evidence Keys**: `true` ✅ (recommended for initial setup)
   - **Evidence Key Type**: `rsa` (or `ec`, `ed25519`)
   - **Evidence Key Alias**: `bookverse-signing-key`
   - **Update Code URLs**: `false` (skip for initial setup)
   - **Update K8s**: `false` (unless you have Kubernetes configured)
5. Click **"Run workflow"**

**What the Switch Platform workflow does:**
- ✅ Configures `JFROG_URL`, `DOCKER_REGISTRY`, `PROJECT_KEY` variables in all service repos
- ✅ Sets `JFROG_ADMIN_TOKEN` secret in all service repos
- ✅ Generates evidence keys (RSA/EC/ED25519) automatically
- ✅ Distributes `EVIDENCE_PRIVATE_KEY` secret to all repos
- ✅ Sets `EVIDENCE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `EVIDENCE_KEY_ALIAS` variables in all repos
- ✅ Uploads public keys to JFrog Platform
- ✅ Validates platform connectivity and authentication

---

### Step 3: Provision JFrog Platform Infrastructure

After Switch Platform completes successfully, run the **🚀 Setup Platform** workflow to provision JFrog infrastructure:

1. Navigate to: `https://github.com/YOUR-ORG/bookverse-demo-init/actions`
2. Select **"🚀 Setup Platform"** workflow
3. Click **"Run workflow"** (no inputs required)

**What the Setup Platform workflow does:**
- ✅ Creates the `bookverse` project in JFrog Platform
- ✅ Sets up artifact repositories (Docker, PyPI, npm, etc.)
- ✅ Configures AppTrust applications with lifecycle stages (DEV, QA, STAGING, PROD)
- ✅ Creates OIDC integrations for GitHub authentication
- ✅ Sets up users and role-based access control

---

### ✅ Setup Complete!

After both workflows complete successfully, your BookVerse platform is ready! 

**📋 Next Steps**: Continue with the [Getting Started Guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for complete setup instructions including Kubernetes deployment.

---

### Alternative: Legacy Local Scripts (Deprecated)

**⚠️ Note**: The old approach using local scripts (`update_evidence_keys.sh`, `configure-service-secrets.sh`) is **deprecated** and only available for backward compatibility. 

**Why use Switch Platform workflow instead?**
- ✅ Better error handling and validation
- ✅ Integrated evidence key generation
- ✅ Automated configuration across all repositories
- ✅ Code URL updates (for platform migrations)
- ✅ Single workflow for all configuration
- ✅ No local environment setup required
- ✅ Workflow-based with comprehensive logging
- ✅ Automatic retry logic for failed operations
